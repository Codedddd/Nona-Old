# Introducing:- Nona V1.0.0!


## How to configure?

<br>

In the "config.yml" file, you need to update the token to your own which you can retrieve at **discord.com/developers/application** and then heading to your application > Bot.

<br>
<br>

After, go to the "Token" label in the YAML file as such:

<br>
<br>

```
Configurations:

  Token: YOUR TOKEN GOES HERE!!!

  Github: https://github.com/Codedddd/Nona

  Discord Server: https://dsc.gg/ariez

  Website: https://ariez.xyz
```

<br>
<br>

Lastly, what you want to do is add your channel names in the "Channels.jsonc" file as shown below:

<br>
<br>

```
{
    "Channel-Names" : [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C",
        "D",
        "E"
    ]
}
```

<br>
<br>

Where the letters are shown, please add your own channels names that are part of the UTF-8 charset and ARE NOT special characters or such.

And don't forget to seperate each channel name with a comma otherwise the terminal will throw errors!

<br>
<br>

Now all you have to do is run the bot, type in to the terminal, when prompted to do so, "nuke" and follow the rest of the steps and BOOM (literally), you have a working Discord nuke bot.

<br>
<br>

## The future of Nona?

<br>

So, althought as of version **1.0.0** there are not many features, in the near future we will be implement multi-processing into the bot to allow for a more streamline experience for the host and to allow for more destruction. Furthermore it is planned to integrate Nona into Overseer -> **github.com/Codedddd/Overseer** to intertwine it with OSINT's and to allow for AI to create auto pastebins and such of target data (although we do not condemn this as this repository is simply a fun project).
